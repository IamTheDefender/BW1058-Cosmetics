# BedWars Cosmetics 
This is an addon that adds various sets of cosmetics to enchance a player's experience in your server. Before you start using this you would require a supported bedwars plugin and some other plugins on which this plugin rely to make it's features work as expected.

This plugin is open source under the GPL-3.0 License

## Contributions
All contributions are welcome, after all, it is better to have all the required features in this plugin itself rather than creating multiple forks. I would really appericate if you contribute into this project. But please note that, try not to use NMS

## Support Server
You can join our [discord support server](discord.iamthedefender.xyz) if you have issues with the plugin but please do check wiki before doing so, you can create a ticket in the discord server only if you think you need immediate help with a critical issue, I check every message whenever I have the time so don't ping me please.
